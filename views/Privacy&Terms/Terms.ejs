    <p>Welcome to Aurora Stays â€“ a student project modeled after Airbnb.</p>

    <p>
      By using this website, you acknowledge that Aurora Stays is not a real booking platform. It is part of a personal software development journey by a student at IIIT Kalyani and is built purely for educational and portfolio purposes.
    </p>

    <p>
      No actual transactions, bookings, or services are processed. Any listings, bookings, or user inputs are simulated for demonstration only.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please do not input sensitive personal information, payment details, or expect actual reservations from this site. The platform may be taken offline or updated at any time as part of ongoing development.
    </p>
